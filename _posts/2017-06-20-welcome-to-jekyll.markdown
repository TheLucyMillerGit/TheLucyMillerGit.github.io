I am a web developer/producer with 6+ yearsâ€™ experience creating and maintaining websites for large

responsive websites. I have used collaborative working tools such as Atlassian JIRA and Intervals for issue 
logging and documentation, and Bugherd for UAT Testing of new design templates on global redesign
